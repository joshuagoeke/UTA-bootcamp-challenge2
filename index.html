                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Josh is the coolest bald dude you know. He's like so super bald the shine from his scalp will blind you in certain light. It's the testosterone. That's really professional for a portfolio page. Oh dear. He's kind of a goofball.GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
                    WHEN I load their portfolio
                    THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
                    WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
                    THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
                    WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
                    THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
                    WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
                    THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
                    WHEN I click on the images of the applications
                    THEN I am taken to that deployed application
                    WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
                    THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport</p>
